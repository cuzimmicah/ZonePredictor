# Fortnite Zone Predictor

### Disclaimer
If you would like to get data for the project you need to purchase API credits from Osirion.gg
The code in this repository may not be correct, if you see something that doesn't make sense please submit and issue so I can fix it!

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the zones in Fortnite using Machine Learning. Fortnite has 12 zones every game, and the zones appear to follow a random pattern. The objective of this project is to find trends or even "solve" the randomness behind these zones, predicting the next zone center based on the data collected.

## How It Works
The project pulls data from an API site called Osirion, which provides information about the center and phase of each zone in various Fortnite matches. The code then formats this data so that the Machine Learning model can effectively use it to make predictions. The outputs generated by the model indicate the center position of the next zone.

## Project Status
Currently, the project is a Work in Progress. The goal is to eventually develop an accurate model that can predict the next zone's center position with high accuracy.

## Project Structure
The codebase consists of the following files:

fetchNformat.py: This script connects to the Osirion API, retrieves data, and formats it for use in the Machine Learning model.
nn.py: This script defines the neural network model that processes the data and makes predictions.
predict.py: This script utilizes the trained model to predict the center of the next zone based on the given data.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install all required libraries

Run the scripts in the following order:
fetchNformat.py to pull and format data.
nn.py to train the model.
predict.py to make predictions based on the trained model.

## Future Work
The project is still under development, and future improvements may include:

Optimizing the model for better accuracy.
Experimenting with different data processing techniques.
Testing the model on various datasets to refine its predictions.
